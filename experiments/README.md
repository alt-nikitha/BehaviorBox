# Manuscript Experiment Results

This directory contains the features we identified for comparisons in our manuscript. The `labels` directory contains validated and manually corrected labels (along with statistics); `sample_annotations_checked` contains individual examples associated with each feature. The statistics in `labels` are calculated from samples that are annotated as `valid`.
